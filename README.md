# Bibb
## By Aaron Snider and Roberto Hernandez

Bibb is a study tracker that will synchronize the time you spend into Google
Calendar (or Microsoft Calendar) as events. It will also have a functionality
for tracking personal study time goals, and maybe even "moral support" to "encourage"
you to stay on topic.
